## content [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `content` property is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to generate content that is to be inserted into an element in the page.
- The content inserted using the content property can be string(s) of text, glyphs, images, counters (for styling lists), or quotes. Combining multiple values into one is also possible.

#### Note

- The content property must be included in the set of rules for the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, otherwise they won't be generated and inserted. 
- Hence, screen readers won't be able to access and read the content generated using pseudo-elements. So, it is recommended that you donâ€™t use pseudo-elements to insert vital content into a page
