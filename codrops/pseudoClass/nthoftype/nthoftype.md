## :nth-of-type() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-of-type()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select **elements of the same type** based on their index (source order) inside their container.
- You can also pass **positive number**, **predefined keywords(even, odd)** and **formula** to `nth-of-tpye()` like `nth-last-child()`.

#### Case: learning `:nth-last-of-type()`

- There is a pseudo-class selector that has a similar functionality to that of `:nth-of-type()`, that selector is the `:nth-last-of-type()` selector. `:nth-last-of-type()` is similar to `:nth-of-type()`, except that instead of iterating through the elements from the first one downwards, it starts iterating from the last element up.
