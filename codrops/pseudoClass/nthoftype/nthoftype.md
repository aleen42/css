- There is a pseudo-class selector that has a similar functionality to that of :nth-last-of-type(), that selector is the :nth-of-type() selector. :nth-of-type() is similar to :nth-last-of-type(), except that instead of iterating through the elements from the last one, it starts iterating from the first one downwards.
