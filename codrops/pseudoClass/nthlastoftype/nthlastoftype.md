## :nth-last-of-type() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-last-of-type()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select **elements of the same type** based on their index (source order) inside their container, **starting from the last element upwards**.
- It's more specific than `nth-last-child()`.
- You can also pass **positive number**, **predefined keywords(even, odd)** and **formula** to `nth-last-of-tpye()` like `nth-last-child()`.

#### Note

- There is a pseudo-class selector that has a similar functionality to that of :nth-last-of-type(), that selector is the :nth-of-type() selector. :nth-of-type() is similar to :nth-last-of-type(), except that instead of iterating through the elements from the last one, it starts iterating from the first one downwards.
