## :nth-last-of-type() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-last-of-type()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select **elements of the same type** based on their index (source order) inside their container, **starting from the last element upwards**.
- It's more specific than `nth-last-child()`.
