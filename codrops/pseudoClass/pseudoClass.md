## Pseudo-class [**Back**](./../codrops.md)

- [**::after**](./after/after.md)
- [**::before**](./before/before.md)

#### Note

###### Different notations: (`:`) and (`::`)

- In CSS1 and CSS2, pseudo-elements were defined to start with one colon (`:`), just like pseudo-classes (for example [`:hover`]()). To distinguish pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes, the double colon notation (`::`) is used in CSS3.
