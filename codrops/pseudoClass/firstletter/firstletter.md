## ::first-letter [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `::first-letter` is a pseudo-element which selects the first letter in the first line of a block-level element (such as a paragraph `<p>`), if that letter is not preceded by any other content (such as **images** or **inline tables**) on its line.
- The `::first-letter` pseudo-element does not select the first letter of an inline-level element; that is, an element that has `display: inline`. It only works on elements that have a display value of `block`, `inline-block`, `table-cell`, `table-caption`, or `list-item`.

#### Case : add a quote before a block quote

```html
<blockquote>
    Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.â€”Nido Qubein
</blockquote>
```

```css
blockquote::before {
    content: "\201C"; /** style of the quote */
    color: deepPink;
    font-size: 3em;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
}
```
