## :lang() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:lang()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that matches an element based on the language it is determined to be in.
- A language is determined in HTML using a combination of the **lang** attribute (e.g `<html lang="en">`), the `<meta>` tag, and possibly by information from the protocol (such as **HTTP headers**). **XML** uses an attribute called `xml:lang`, and there may be other document language-specific methods for determining the language.
