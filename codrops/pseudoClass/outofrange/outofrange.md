## :out-of-range [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:out-of-range` is a CSS pseudo-class used to style elements that have range limitations when the value that the element bound to is outside the specified range limits.
- Examples of elements with range limitations are sliders and inputs that accept a number as a value. For example:

```html
<input type="number">
```

- Such an input would have a range of acceptable values specified using the min and max attributes. The value attribute would hold the current value of the input.

```html
<input type="number" min="1" max="10" value="8">
```
