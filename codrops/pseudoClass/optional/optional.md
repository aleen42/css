## :optiona [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:optional` is a CSS pseudo-class selector used to select form elements that are optional.
- More specifically, it is used to select form elements that are not **required**; that is, form elements that do not have the required attribute set.
- The form elements than can be selected using `:optional` are `<input>`s, `<select>`s, and `<textarea>`s **without a required** attribute.
