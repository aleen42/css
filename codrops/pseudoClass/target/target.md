## :target [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:target` pseudo-class is used to style an element that is the target of an internal link in a document.
- Some web pages contain links that point to certain sections or elements on the same page, instead of pointing to other pages. Such links point to elements in the page that have a certain ID, and they point to them by using an element's ID as the value for the link's href attribute. For example, the following link points to an element on the page with an ID of **article-demo**.
