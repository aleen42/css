## :focus [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:focus` is a pseudo-class used to select and style elements, usually **links** and **form** elements, that have been focused by the user, either by "tabbing" using the keyboard or by clicking.
- Form elements, such as `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<textarea>` can receive focus either by tabbing using the keyboard or by clicking. An input field or a textarea are in focus when they are clicked and ready to be typed in.
