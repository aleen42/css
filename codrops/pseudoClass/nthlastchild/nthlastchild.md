## :nth-child() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-last-child()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select elements based on their index (source order) inside their container, **starting from the last element upwards**.
- You can also pass **positive number**, **predefined keywords(even, odd)** and **formula** to `nth-last-child()` like `nth-child()`.
