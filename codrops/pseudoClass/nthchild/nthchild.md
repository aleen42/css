## :nth-child() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-child()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select elements based on their index (source order) inside their container.
- You can pass in a **positive number** as an argument to `:nth-child()`, which will select the one element whose index inside its parent matches the argument of :nth-child(). For example, li:nth-child(3) will select the list item with an index value 3; that is, it will select the third list item.
