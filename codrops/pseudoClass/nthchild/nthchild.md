## :nth-child() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- The `:nth-child()` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that allows you to select elements based on their index (source order) inside their container.
- You can pass in a **positive number** as an argument to `:nth-child()`, which will select the one element whose index inside its parent matches the argument of `:nth-child()`. For example, `li:nth-child(3)` will select the list item with an index value **3**; that is, it will select the third list item.
- You can also pass in one of two predefined keywords: **even** and **odd**.
    - `li:nth-child(even)` will select all list items with even index numbers **(2, 4, 6, 8, etc.)**
    - `li:nth-child(odd)` will select all list items with odd index numbers **(1, 3, 5, 7, etc.)**
- You can also use a **formula** (or an **equation**)
    - `li:nth-child(an+b)`: to divide into **a** groups and select the **b**th element of each group.

- Using some tools to help dealing with the calculations for `nth-child` by visualizing.

- There is a pseudo-class selector that has a similar functionality to that of `:nth-child()`, that selector is the `:nth-last-child()` selector. `:nth-last-child()` is similar to `:nth-child`, except that instead of iterating through the elements from the first one downwards, it starts iterating from the last element up.
