## :invalid [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:invalid` is a CSS pseudo-class used to select and style form `<input>` elements whose value is invalid according to its type specified in the **type** attribute.
- For example, number input types (`<input type="number">`) that have an alphabet character value, or email inputs (`<input type="email">`) whose value does not match a valid email address pattern.
- In some browsers, :invalid also matches a form (`<form>`) and a fieldset (`<fieldset>`) that have one or more input elements that have invalid values according to their type value.
