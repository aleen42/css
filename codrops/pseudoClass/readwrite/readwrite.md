## :read-write [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:read-write` is a CSS pseudo-class selector that matches elements that are **editable** by the user.
- Elements that fall into the editable category include:
    - `<input>` elements (of any type) that are **not read-only** and that are **not disabled**.
    - `<textarea>`s that are neither read-only nor disabled (similar to the inputs).
    - Any other element that is not an `<input>` or a `<textarea>`, and that has the contenteditable attribute set.
