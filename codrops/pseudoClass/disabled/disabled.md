## :disabled [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:disabled` is a pseudo-class selector used to select and style user interface elements (usually form elements) that are disabled.
- That is, it matches elements such as buttons (`<button>`), select menus (`<select>`), input types (`<input>`), and textareas (`<textarea>`), for example, that have the disabled attribute set and thus cannot be interacted with by the user.
