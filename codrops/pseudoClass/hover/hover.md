## :fullscreen [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:hover` is a pseudo-class used to select and style an element when it is being hovered by the user.
- An element is hovered over when the user designates it with a pointing device, like pointing at it by placing the mouse over it, without necessarily **activating** it.
