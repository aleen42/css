## :dir() [**Back**](./../pseudoClass.md)

- `:dir()` CSS pseudo-class selector is used to select an element based on its directionality as determined by the document language.
- The direction of text in an element can be specified using the CSS `direction` property. However, the :dir() pseudo-class selector does not match an element whose directionality is solely specified using the direction propertyâ€”the directionality needs to be specified in the document to match the selector, not in CSS, because :dir() does not select based on stylistic states.
